### Project Overview

Mr. Chang, a visionary entrepreneur with a chain of mobile phone shops spanning Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, and India, recognized the pivotal role of data in shaping his 2025 sales strategy. As an independent data analyst, I was engaged to dissect his 2024 sales performance, unearth actionable insights, and provide a clear roadmap for sustained growth and increased revenue in the coming year. This project highlights my end-to-end data analysis process, from understanding business needs and data preparation to deriving insights and offering strategic recommendations.

-----

### 1\. Understanding the Business Needs: The Foundation of Insight

My initial step was to deeply engage with Mr. Chang and his team to fully comprehend their objectives. It became clear that the core business need was to identify the **drivers of 2024 sales performance** and leverage these insights to formulate a robust sales plan for 2025. This meant understanding:

  * **What factors influenced sales in 2024?** This encompassed identifying periods of growth and decline, product performance, customer demographics, and geographical contributions.
  * **How can successful strategies be sustained and amplified?** This required pinpointing positive trends and understanding their underlying causes.
  * **Where are the opportunities for improvement?** This involved identifying areas of underperformance and suggesting corrective actions.

-----

### 2\. Data Acquisition & Preparation: Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Assets

With a clear understanding of the business objectives, I collaborated closely with Mr. Chang's data management team to gain secure access to the raw sales data. The data, initially in a less-than-optimal format, required significant processing to unlock its full potential. Leveraging **Power Query**, I executed a meticulous data preparation phase, focusing on:

  * **Irrelevant Column Removal:** Streamlining the dataset by eliminating columns that didn't contribute to the analytical objectives, thereby improving processing efficiency and clarity.
  * **Fact and Dimension Table Separation:** Implementing a **star schema design** to create a robust and scalable data model. This involved separating transactional data (facts) from descriptive attributes (dimensions) such as products, customers, and locations. This not only optimized query performance but also enhanced data integrity and ease of analysis.
  * **Data Type Formatting:** Ensuring data consistency and accuracy by meticulously formatting data types (e.g., numerical values, dates, text) to enable accurate calculations and prevent errors during analysis. This crucial step laid the groundwork for reliable insights.

### 3\. Exploratory Data Analysis & Key Insights: Unveiling the Narrative of 2024 Sales

With the data meticulously prepared, I embarked on a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), employing both Power BI (for initial visualizations and dashboarding) and Python (for deeper statistical analysis and correlation studies). This phase was critical in uncovering the underlying trends and patterns that defined Mr. Chang's 2024 sales performance.

#### Overall Performance Snapshot:

  * **Total Revenue:** A commendable **$14.53 Million** was generated.
  * **Total Purchases:** **19,000 mobile phones** were sold.
  * **Average Transaction Value:** Each transaction held an average value of **$783**.
  * **Overall Monthly Sales Growth:** A positive trend with an average monthly growth of **9.84%**.

#### Temporal Sales Dynamics:

A preliminary view of monthly sales revealed distinct fluctuations, providing valuable insights into seasonal trends and market responsiveness:

  * **Significant Sales Spikes:**

      * **May:** +10%
      * **July:** +21.77%
      * **October:** +32.01%
      * **December:** +15.57%
        These surges likely indicate successful promotional campaigns, new product launches, or peak consumer buying periods. Further investigation into specific marketing efforts or product releases during these months would yield deeper understanding.

  * **Greatest Sales Drop:**

      * **September:** -20.9%
        This significant decline warrants immediate attention. Understanding the contributing factors – whether it was a lack of promotional activity, increased competition, or broader economic factors – is crucial for strategic planning in 2025.

#### Revenue vs. Purchase Discrepancy:

  * **March, April, and August:** While these months saw an **increase in mobile phone purchases**, there was a concerning **corresponding drop in revenue**. This highlights a critical disconnect, suggesting potential issues such as:
      * Sales of lower-priced devices.
      * Aggressive discounting leading to reduced profit margins.
      * Increased returns or cancellations that impacted final revenue figures.
        This insight demands a deeper dive into product mix and pricing strategies during these periods.

#### Operating System Performance:

  * **Android Dominance:** Android phones were the unequivocal revenue driver, contributing a substantial **74.9% of total revenue**.
  * **iOS Contribution:** iOS devices accounted for **25.08%** of the revenue.
    This clear disparity suggests that while Android is the bread and butter, there might be untapped potential within the iOS market or opportunities to optimize the iOS product offering and marketing.

#### Geographical Revenue Contribution:

The store locations exhibited significant variations in revenue generation:

  * **Top Performers:**

      * **India:** 47.98% of total revenue
      * **Turkey:** 37.33% of total revenue
        These two regions are the powerhouse of Mr. Chang's business and should be prioritized for continued investment and strategic expansion.

  * **Bottom Performers:**

      * **Bangladesh:** 12.06% of total revenue
      * **Pakistan:** 2.63% of total revenue
        These regions represent significant opportunities for growth. Understanding the specific challenges and market dynamics in Bangladesh and Pakistan is paramount to developing targeted strategies for improvement.

#### Brand Performance:

  * **Apple Leads Revenue:** Despite Android's overall dominance, individual brand analysis revealed that **Apple contributed the most revenue at 25.08%**. This indicates a strong premium segment within Apple's user base.
  * **Xiaomi at the Bottom:** Xiaomi generated the least revenue at **12.53%**. This could be due to lower price points, less market penetration, or a different target demographic.

#### Product Attribute Analysis:

  * **Color Preference:** **Black-colored phones were purchased the most at 22.4%**, indicating a strong consumer preference for this aesthetic.

  * **Storage Size & Revenue Discrepancy:**

      * **128GB storage phones generated the most revenue (approximately 34.9%)**.
      * However, customers **purchased 256GB and 64GB devices more frequently than 128GB**.
        This intriguing insight suggests that while 128GB models command higher prices or have better margins, the sales volume lies with other storage capacities. This necessitates a review of inventory management and pricing strategies across different storage options to optimize both revenue and sales volume.

  * **Value Segment Performance:**

      * **Medium-valued phones:** 43.9% of purchases
      * **Low-valued phones:** 44.46% of purchases
      * **High-valued phones:** 11.58% of purchases
        The data clearly indicates that Mr. Chang's customer base predominantly opts for medium and low-valued mobile phones. This understanding is crucial for inventory planning, marketing efforts, and targeted promotions.

#### Customer Demographics:

  * **Age Segmentation:** Customers aged **26-33 years purchased more than any other age group**. This demographic represents the most lucrative target audience for marketing campaigns and product offerings.
  * **Gender Distribution:**
      * **Females:** 50% of customers
      * **Males:** 41.21% of customers
      * **Other:** 8.73% of customers
        This provides valuable insight into the gender breakdown of the customer base, allowing for more tailored marketing messaging.

### 4\. Advanced Analytics: Unveiling the Correlation

To further deepen the insights and understand the underlying relationships within the data, I utilized **Python** to conduct a correlation study.

  * **Sales and Quantity Purchased Correlation:** A strong positive correlation was identified between sales and quantity purchased, with a **correlation value of 0.74**. This indicates that as the quantity of mobile phones purchased increases, sales revenue tends to increase significantly. This seemingly intuitive finding serves to validate the importance of maintaining robust stock levels and optimizing sales processes to convert purchases into revenue efficiently.

### 5\. Recommendations for 2025: A Data-Driven Roadmap

Based on the comprehensive analysis, I've formulated a set of actionable recommendations designed to drive Mr. Chang's sales performance in 2025:

1.  **Strategic Focus on High-Growth Months:** Analyze the factors contributing to the sales spikes in May, July, October, and December 2024. Replicate successful marketing campaigns, promotions, and product launches during these periods in 2025. Consider pre-emptive stock adjustments to capitalize on anticipated demand.

2.  **Mitigating September's Sales Drop:** Conduct a thorough post-mortem of September 2024's sales performance. Investigate market trends, competitor activities, and internal operational issues that may have contributed to the decline. Develop a proactive strategy for September 2025, potentially involving targeted promotions, new product introductions, or competitive pricing.

3.  **Optimizing Revenue for Increased Purchases:** Address the disconnect between increased purchases and decreased revenue in March, April, and August. This requires:

      * **Product Mix Analysis:** Determine if these months saw a disproportionate sale of lower-margin devices.
      * **Pricing Strategy Review:** Evaluate discounting policies and ensure they are aligned with revenue goals.
      * **Bundling Opportunities:** Explore bundling lower-priced phones with accessories or services to increase average transaction value.

4.  **Leveraging Android Dominance while Exploring iOS Potential:**

      * **Sustain Android Focus:** Continue to prioritize Android device inventory, marketing, and promotions, as it's the primary revenue driver.
      * **Strategic iOS Growth:** Investigate opportunities to increase iOS market share. This could involve targeted marketing to iOS users, competitive pricing strategies, or expanding the range of available Apple products.

5.  **Geographical Expansion and Optimization:**

      * **Fortify Top Markets (India & Turkey):** Continue investing in these high-performing regions through localized marketing, expanding store presence where feasible, and optimizing supply chains.
      * **Strategic Growth in Underperforming Markets (Bangladesh & Pakistan):** Develop tailored strategies for these regions. This might include:
          * **Market Research:** Understanding local preferences, purchasing power, and competitive landscape.
          * **Localized Product Offerings:** Introducing phones that align with local affordability and demand.
          * **Targeted Marketing:** Developing culturally relevant campaigns.
          * **Partnerships:** Exploring collaborations with local distributors or telecommunication providers.

6.  **Brand Portfolio Optimization:**

      * **Capitalize on Apple's High Revenue:** Despite lower purchase volume, Apple's high revenue contribution suggests a strong premium segment. Focus on maintaining strong relationships with Apple and ensure adequate stock of popular models.
      * **Re-evaluate Xiaomi Strategy:** Analyze the reasons for Xiaomi's lower revenue contribution. This could involve exploring different Xiaomi models, adjusting pricing, or targeting a different customer segment.

7.  **Optimizing Product Attribute Sales:**

      * **Black Phone Inventory:** Ensure consistent availability of black-colored phones due to high demand.
      * **Strategic Storage Size Management:** Reconcile the discrepancy between 128GB revenue and 256GB/64GB purchase volume. Consider:
          * **Promoting 128GB:** Offer incentives or highlight value propositions to encourage more 128GB purchases.
          * **Optimizing 256GB/64GB Margins:** Explore ways to increase profitability on these high-volume sellers without deterring purchases.

8.  **Targeted Marketing to Key Demographics:**

      * **Focus on 26-33 Age Group:** Tailor marketing campaigns, social media content, and product recommendations specifically for this highly engaged demographic.
      * **Inclusive Marketing:** Continue to develop marketing materials that resonate with both male and female audiences, given the relatively even gender distribution.

9.  **Leveraging the Sales-Quantity Correlation:** Given the strong positive correlation between sales and quantity purchased, continuous efforts should be made to:

      * **Maintain Optimal Inventory Levels:** Prevent stockouts of popular models, especially during peak seasons.
      * **Streamline Sales Processes:** Ensure efficient order fulfillment and reduce any friction points in the customer journey that could deter purchases.
      * **Incentivize Bulk Purchases (where applicable):** Explore strategies for encouraging customers to purchase more than one device, especially for businesses or families.
